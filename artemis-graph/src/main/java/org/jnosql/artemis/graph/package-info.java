/**
 * In computing, a graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes,
 * edges and properties to represent and store data. A key concept of the system is the graph
 * (or edge or relationship), which directly relates data items in the store. The relationships allow data in
 * the store to be linked together directly, and in many cases retrieved with one operation.
 * This contrasts with conventional relational databases, where links between data are stored in the data,
 * and queries search for this data within the store and use the join concept to collect the related data.
 * Graph databases, by design, allow simple and fast retrieval of complex hierarchical structures that are difficult
 * to model in relational systems. Graph databases are similar to 1970s network model databases in that both represent
 * general graphs, but network-model databases operate at a lower level of abstraction and lack easy traversal over
 * a chain of edges.
